Homework from the third and fourth week of the Spring Boot 2 course.

REST API for the car list. The car has fields: id, mark, model, colour. The API supports several web methods. Three items are added at the start of the application.

The application has the ability to return data in XML form and supports Swagger UI.

The application has been extended with a graphical user interface. Vaadin was used for this purpose.
